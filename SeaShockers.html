		<h1><u>Sea Shockers</u></h1>
		<h3>Sea Shockers are Tidal Class dragons.  They have two pointed heads.  Their bodies are wide and thrir tails are not unlike Scauldrens's.  Instead of fire, their defence system is electricity that runs throughought their body giving the opponent quite a shock, hence the name. They only eat deep sea fish, so they usually stay in deep water and "rarley ever surface" quoting the dragon rider Fishlegs.</h3>
