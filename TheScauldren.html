		<h1><u>The Scauldren</u></h1>
		<br>
		<h3>The Scauldren is a Tidal class dragon, but they can fly if they don't want to swim, for example or if they are hunting and want to get ahead of or jump on their prey.  A Scauldren has a big body and is a very large dragon.  They have large heads that have a horn arc curved above their head, and long necks.  Their stomachs are large like their wings. Their tails are long like their necks.  The ends of their tails are flat and fan-like.  Instead of fire, they shoot boiling hot water blasts which they heat up and then blast at their opponent or prey.  Also, if you find that you and your dragon have been to close to a Blue Oleander flower (which are poisonous/an allergen to reptiles(including dragons)), the venom of the Scauldren is an antidote, for the Scauldren is the only dragon that<i> eats </i>Blue Oleander.</h3>
