		<h1><u>Thunderdrums</u></h1>
		<h3>Thunderdrums are Tidal Class dragons.  They have wide bodies and long wings. They have huge mouths like their wide bodies.  Instead of fire, they have a roar so loud if you get hit by it, you cannot hear people for a while unless they are screaming.  Because of this, "Thunderdrums are hard of hearing" quoting famous dragon rider Hiccup.  When a baby Thunderdrum is hatching, it is said that it creats a tromendusly loud sound.</h3>
